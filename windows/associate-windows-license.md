# Associating a Windows license with your Microsoft account

Under your Windows user in Control Panel, associate your local account with your Microsoft account.

To avoid needing to login to the computer with your Microsoft account password, which for me, I generate randomly via 1Password, opt to create a "PIN" afterwards, and use numbers and letters so that you can just set your original password you used as when you had just a regular local Windows account.

Afterwards, you can log into your Microsoft online account, and you'll see the associated Windows activated and associated to your Microsoft account, which you should then be able to transfer between computers if you were to reinstall Windows for example.
